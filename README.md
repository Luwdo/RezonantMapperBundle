# Rezonant's MapperBundle

MapperBundle provides an annotation-based method for mapping to and from model classes.
The provided annotations center around request-to-model and model-to-entity mapping operations, but maps can also be supplied by the caller allowing for flexible reuse. 

This library is in a very early state.

# Testing

To run the tests, run
   
    $ cd mapper-bundle
    $ symfony new symfony2
    $ phpunit
